During the project, I worked on the database [**Pump It Up**](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/).

*final_project* is a main notebook. It contains description, data cleaning and data preprocessing. Main models were built (CatBoostClassifier) there.
`Random Forest` models were built to find out what features can be dropped according to their influence on the final accuracy score (`f1_score`).

A notebook `cat_grid` contains grid search for CatBoostClassifier.
