TA comments:
Problem 3.2 [13/17]. Forward implemented in bad manner. There exist more suitable solution in terms of complexity.

### Homework 2. 141/143 pts

TA comments:
Problem 2.2.5 [1/2] (it's not about abs of eigenvalue, but about eigenvalue having a multiplicity of 2 and spanning a linear space). Problem 2.2.8 [1/2] (you were supposed to use pagerank_matvec on pagerank matrix and not on adjacency matrix).

Model Compression for Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles

*Investigate how compression methods based on tensor decomposition for linear and convolutional layers influence the uncertainty estimation of neural networks in classification task*

**Results**

 - Reproduce the comparison of Deep Ensembles and Monte Carlo Dropout
 - Show the relation between rank of SVD and TT decompositions and classification performance
 - Experimentally prove that proper approximation rank still provides an opportunity for estimating the uncertainty in OOD cases

In particular, we show that too intensive compression of model leads to additional uncertainty and does not allow to detect the OOD samples.

**P.S.** We did not have to submit the code. So, there is nothing left but presentation.
