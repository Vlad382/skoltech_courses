Finite Volume Method with Inhomogenous Parameters for Realistic Geological Models based on SPE10

**Occupation**

Created a convenient API for SGeMS (The Stanford Geostatistical Modeling Software). Made an access to kriging and co-kriging algorithms via [PySgems](https://github.com/robinthibaut/pysgems) library.

Examples of creating similar models to SPE 10 model 2 by taking random points/wells data from the original model with kriging and co-kriging.

**P.S.:** No report was needed, slides only.
