Finite Volume Method with Inhomogenous Parameters for Realistic Geological Models based on SPE10

*Create a convenient method for geostatistical geneartion of geological fields with SGeMS (The Stanford Geostatistical Modeling Software). Implement FVM with inhomogenous parameters*

**Results**

 - Created a convenient API for SGeMS
 - Made an access to kriging and co-kriging algorithms via [PySgems](https://github.com/robinthibaut/pysgems) library
 - FVM is implemented
 - Examples of creating similar models based on SPE 10 model 2 by taking random points/wells data from the original model with kriging and co-kriging are provided

**P.S.** No report was needed, slides only.
